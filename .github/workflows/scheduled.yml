  update:
    # This action checks that updating the dependencies of this crate to the latest available that
    # satisfy the versions in Cargo.toml does not break this crate. This is important as consumers
    # of this crate will generally use the latest available crates. This is subject to the standard
    # Cargo semver rules (i.e cargo does not update to a new major version unless explicitly told
    # to).

    # There's no point running this if no Cargo.lock was checked in in the first place, since we'd
    # just redo what happened in the regular test job. Unfortunately, hashFiles only works in if on
    # steps, so we repeat it.
