    <h1>Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon</h1>
    <p>
        Why is so little known of female artists, scientists, politicians, and so forth? This is one of the first
        questions which arises whenever any kind of history is about to be written. One of the reasons for this is that
        historiography relies on existing biographical dictionaries, most of which contain very few entries for women.
        The Biographical Dictionary of Swedish Women (SKBL) resolves this dilemma by providing free (<a
            href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="visible_link" target="_blank">CC-BY licensed</a>)
        access to 2000 biographies of women who actively contributed to Swedish society.
    </p>
    <p>
        The images used in SKBL come from museums, archives and private collections. SKBL does not own any of the images
        and therefore cannot give permission for them to be reproduced.
    </p>
    <p>SKBL is managed by KvinnSam. KvinnSam is a university-wide research infrastructure and a national library
        for gender research, and a part of the Humanities Library at University of Gothenburg.

                SKBL is produced by the University of Gothenburg. The articles are written by experts and researchers,
                whilst the work has been financed by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond. The dictionary contains biographies of
                women who, across several centuries and in many different ways, have contributed to society’s
                development, both within Sweden and beyond. The entries, based on a mix of existing and brand-new
                research, were mainly selected with an emphasis on societal significance rather than personal fame. The
                selection includes female pioneers and women who fought for gender equality as well as historically
                significant women. Finnish women are also included for the pre-1809 era.

                The article authors have compiled searchable biographical information for each dictionary entry. The
                editors have further supplemented these with material from Sveriges dödbok, Svensk arkivinformation’s
                (SVAR) collections of census and church records, as well as similar material from Arkiv Digital. The
                editors have also included references and links.

                If you are looking for a particular woman you can select either <a href="/en/article"
                    class="visible_link">Women A-Z</a> or the search box. Each article comprises a biography focusing on
                the subject’s activities and their wider significance, along with biographical information on the
                subject’s background, education, activities and occupations, club and organisational memberships,
                networks and awards. The articles also supply references and information on archival and public
                memorials.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                Each subject’s portrait is preceded by a link to a map illustrating the subject’s birthplace, geographical area of activities, and place of death.
            </p> -->

            <p>
                The free-text search box, which calls up the biographies, can be combined with searches in the fields
                labelled activities, organisations, placenames and keywords.

            Further information on the selection process and methodology</h4>
        <span class="ellipsis_contents">
            <p>
                The catalyst behind SKBL is the relative invisibility of women’s contributions to society through the
                ages. The gender bias of much written history can be partly attributed to archival criteria used in
                material preservation and classification. However, it is also a result of historical circumstances:
                women have for various reasons been subordinate to men for several centuries, even into the present day.
                Special efforts are required to rectify the misleading impression given by written histories. SKBL has
                therefore created a database to collate and present information on women’s achievements through the ages
                in an accessible format. This creates a new starting point for future historical research whilst also
                providing a more balanced and fair image of Swedish history.
            </p>

            <p>
                SKBL contains the life histories of historical women who have contributed to societal developments in
                many ways. The project used the following criteria to select the initial candidates for inclusion:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Women who have a Swedish connection, either by birth or because their activities largely occurred
                    within Sweden. The term Sweden is defined in its historical-geographical terms and thus includes
                    Finland for the pre-1809 period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women who have contributed to societal developments at international, national and regional levels.
                    These activities include: international aid, education, science, politics, care and welfare, as well
                    as cultural engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women who have played a particular role in writing history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women who have been pioneers, including within the spheres of sports, culture, institutions,
                    political organisations, or professions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women who were significant within the struggle for gender equality.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                By searching <a href="/en/biographies" class="visible_link">earlier biographical works</a> and research
                literature the project group identified about 3,000 women who fulfil some of these criteria.
                Subsequently checks were made to evaluate whether enough documentation existed to generate a
                biographical article. This process reduced the number of potential entries by 1,000. Those who left
                significant personal archives, such as artists and authors, formed a majority of the remaining
                candidates. Similarly, women who were active within areas which have been heavily researched – such as
                the suffrage movement – also form a significant group.
            </p>

            <p>
                The third stage involved finding authors, largely from within the academic sphere, but also from amongst
                museum staff, librarians, and other cultural institutions, as well as amongst hobby researchers, who had
                already researched particular women. What they all have in common is a special knowledge of the person
                they are writing about. Most requests for article contributions were favourably received, but
                availability and willingness sometimes determined the final outcome.
            </p>

            <p>
                This first selection of women’s biographies is thus not comprehensive. The majority of women’s societal
                contributions will remain invisible as they have not been documented. The extant contents of archival
                collections resulted in the dictionary and the database being heavily weighted in favour of women who
                lived in the 1800s and 1900s. Women who represented earlier time periods are overwhelmingly dominated by
                noble and royal personages, whilst the later time periods are also highly represented by the upper
                echelons of society. Women from these social strata tended to have better opportunities to leave an
                imprint on the archives.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each biography consists of two parts. One contains biographical information collated within clickable
                and searchable links. The other contains the life history along with searchable keywords, as well as an
                image in most cases. All the material has been manually input into the database.
            </p>

            <p>
                The article authors and the project group have worked very hard to uncover as much biographical
                information as possible but have had to rely on whatever state a given archive is in. Sometimes the
                required biographical information is lacking.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the form for biographical data which all article authors were required to complete
                (origins, activities, education, important contacts, organisational memberships, residence locations,
                marriage(s), children, awards) including their references, the authors have supplied a summarised
                biography (1,000-10,000 characters in length) focusing on a given woman’s activities. The project group
                has edited the articles in order to create a certain uniformity without removing the individual author’s
                style. The authors were encouraged to proof their articles. The project group has also checked the
                spelling of all institutional names, organisational names, etc. so that they correspond with
                <em>Nationalencyklopedien</em> and that references correspond to LIBRIS. Personal information has also
                been corroborated and, if necessary, added to with the help of SCB’s census accounts and existing church
                records at parish level.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the work has progressed it has become increasingly clear that the biographical data collated by the
                project group forms an essential element of how SKBL will be used by researchers. In addition to free
                text searches, various social circumstances can be combined and searched on. This will have an
                exponential impact on what it is possible to know about the different women in the dictionary, and by
                extension, about women’s history in general.
            </p>

            <p>
                In summary, the life histories contained in the database do not form a comprehensive map of women’s
                history in Sweden from the Middle Ages to the present. However, they are a start.
